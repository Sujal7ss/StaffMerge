## üîÑ Data Flow & Business Logic

### User Registration Flow
1. User submits registration form with profile photo
2. File uploaded to Cloudinary via Multer
3. Password hashed with bcryptjs
4. User saved to MongoDB
5. JWT token generated and set in cookie

### Job Posting Flow
1. Recruiter creates job posting
2. Job linked to company and creator
3. Job saved with all requirements
4. Available for students to view and apply

### Application Flow
1. Student views job listings
2. Clicks "Apply" on desired job
3. Application created linking user and job
4. Recruiter can view applicants
5. Recruiter can update application status

### File Upload Flow
1. Multer middleware handles file upload
2. DataURI converts file to base64
3. Cloudinary uploads file and returns URL
4. URL stored in database
